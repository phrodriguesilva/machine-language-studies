# machine-language-studies
This repository contains my studies in Assembly machine language. Most of the exercises are part of a subject at my college called "Computer Architecture and Organization" and the rest is a collection of exercises I found on the internet and developed. I used the Mars development interface (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)
